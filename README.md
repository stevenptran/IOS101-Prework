## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

    - Organizes courses, making it easy to see grades, syllabus, etc.
- Gmail
    - Gives the ability to have access to multiple gmail accounts and shows mail from all inboxes
    - Can upload files from your phone as well as download them
- Duolingo
    - Educational game, which makes learning feel like a game
    - Very nice friends/social system, allowing you to commend your friends for their achievements

I would like to build a simple video game which allows you to flip tiles to match with other tiles. I want this app to allow users to upload their own images as well as customize the colors of the app. It would allow you to increase the difficulty by adding a time limit or adding more tiles. I would like to build this idea because I have always wanted to build a video game, and this would be a great start to my first video game app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
